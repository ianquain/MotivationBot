# MotivationBot
A Twitter Bot designed to send motivational quotes to anyone that mentions it.

This bot is made using node.js and runs off of the Twit package.
It is currently hosted live on the internet and the bot can be found at @Bot_ivate on Twitter.

This is the finalised product, there was talk about moving the array that contains the quotes but I think I'll move onto other stuff 
instead, anyway, if you guys are looking to use this code, it is open for public use, just shoot me a message to let me know you'd 
like a copy of the code!
